                Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi (Urdu: عمران احمد خان نیازی , pronounced [ɪmɾaːn ɛɦməd xaːn nɪjaːziː]; born 5
                October 1952) is a Pakistani politician and former cricketer who served as the 22nd prime minister of
                Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. He is the founder and former chairman of the political party
                Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) from 1996 to 2023. He was the captain of the Pakistan national cricket
                team throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

                Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in
                a 1971 Test series against England. Khan played until 1992, served as the team's captain intermittently
                between 1982 and 1992, and won the 1992 Cricket World Cup, Pakistan's only victory in the competition.
                Considered one of cricket's greatest all-rounders, Khan was later inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of
                Fame. Founding the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in 1996, Khan won a seat in the National Assembly in
                the 2002 general election, serving as an opposition member from Mianwali until 2007. PTI boycotted the
                2008 general election and became the second-largest party by popular vote in the 2013 general election.
                In the 2018 general election, running on a populist platform, PTI became the largest party in the
                National Assembly, and formed a coalition government with independents with Khan as prime minister.

                As prime minister, Khan addressed a balance of payments crisis with bailouts from the IMF. He presided
                over a shrinking current account deficit, and limited defence spending to curtail the fiscal deficit,
                leading to some general economic growth. He enacted policies that increased tax collection and
                investment as well as advocated for transforming Pakistan into a welfare state. His government committed
                to a renewable energy transition, launched Ehsaas Programme and the Plant for Pakistan initiative, and
                expanded the protected areas of Pakistan. He presided over the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused economic
                turmoil and rising inflation in the country, threatening his political position.

                In early 2022, in what became known as Lettergate, Khan alleged that the United States encouraged his
                removal from office. In April, during the ensuing constitutional crisis, Khan became the first Pakistani
                prime minister to be removed from office through a no-confidence motion. In August, he was charged under
                anti-terror laws after accusing the police and judiciary of detaining and torturing an aide. In October,
                Khan was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan from taking office for the current term of
                the National Assembly of Pakistan, regarding the Toshakhana reference case. In November, he survived an
                assassination attempt during a political rally in Wazirabad, Punjab.
